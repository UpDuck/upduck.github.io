Troubleshooting
===============
In some cases you may have problems getting started, here are some more
materials to help.

I can't connect connect my mobile and computer
----------------------------------------------

This frequently occurs due to the complexity of home networking.

Your WiFi router can be part of the problem.
********************************************

If your computer is wired, check that your router allows connections between
the wired and wireless connections.

If you computer is wireless, check that your router allows connections between
wireless connections.

If you mobile and computers are on different spectrums (5Ghz, 3Ghz) (radios),
check that your router allows connections between them, or switch to the same
spectrum.

Your mobile device may be part of the problem
*********************************************

Due to variance in devices, and customization by vendors, or even carriers, it's
not possible to tell you if your device has a setting like these, or exactly where
you might find it.

Android "speed boost": Some mobile devices with cellular and WiFi are configured
with a split `acceleration` or  settings intended to make downloads faster, this
works by using both connections, which in our case can prevent connections in
the first place or cause them to randomly drop out.

Android "Switch to mobile data": If you device detects that your signal is weak
or otherwise poor, it may try to automatically switch back to cellular data, this
can prevent initial connections or interrupt on-going connections.

If your having problems connecting on a mobile with cellular, and can't find one
of theses settings, its advisable to disable the cellular radio, this can
often be done by putting the device into airplane mode and turning the WiFi
radio back on.s

Your computer may be part of the problem
****************************************

You could have a firewall and blocking the connection to the port.

In Windows 8 / 10, this can also be due to the network interface not being in
"private" or "home" network modes, when in "public" the firewall restricts far
more traffic and can be blocking you connection attempts
